# AI-Powered-Healthcare-Disease-Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and healthcare data to predict diseases such as Weight Gain, Hypertension, and Heart Disease based on user attributes like:

Age

Gender

Weight

Activity Level

Dietary Preferences

The system uses advanced machine learning models to provide accurate predictions, enabling early detection and personalized health recommendations.

🚀 Features

Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of health risks including Weight Gain, Hypertension, and Heart Disease.

ML Model Comparison: Evaluates multiple models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM).

High Accuracy: Achieved a 99.7% F1 Score with Gradient Boosting Classifier, outperforming other models.

User-Friendly Inputs: Accepts demographic, lifestyle, and dietary attributes.

Healthcare Insights: Provides explainable predictions for better medical decision-making.
